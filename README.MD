# Kaggle Ship identification

Some work I did in 2018 on BAEs ship identification kaggle comeptition using Pytorch-UNet. My first usage of ML, had some success that can be seen in the train/basic_evaluation folder.

## Notes

- Need to impliment scoring system to test accuracy of prediction

- rewrite pytorch-unet

- look into how the model takes into account edges of shapes

- look into implimenting C functions to increase speed?

- impliment mask encode - submit function. (pytorch-unet has most of this)

- error handling


- Build data-set with half ships, half sea
